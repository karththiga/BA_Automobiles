```{r setup, include=FALSE}

Engine Size Analysis
```{r}
mean_engine <- mean(auto$engine_size)
median_engine <- median(auto$engine_size)
sd_engine <- sd(auto$engine_size)

mean_engine
median_engine
sd_engine

ggplot(auto, aes(x = engine_size)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),
                 bins = 30,
                 fill = "lightblue",
                 color = "black") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = mean_engine, sd = sd_engine),
                color = "red",
                linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Bell Curve of Engine Size",
       x = "Engine Size (Litres)",
       y = "Density")

```
Interpretation
The bell curve shows that most vehicles cluster around a moderate engine size. This indicates a preference for balanced performance and fuel efficiency. Vehicles with extremely large engines are less common, making mid-range engine vehicles more suitable for Sri Lanka’s congested urban roads and mixed terrain.



horse power analysis
```{r}
mean_hp <- mean(auto$horsepower)
median_hp <- median(auto$horsepower)
sd_hp <- sd(auto$horsepower)

# Bell curve of horsepower
ggplot(auto, aes(x = horsepower)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),
                 bins = 30,
                 fill = "lightgreen",
                 color = "black") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = mean_hp, sd = sd_hp),
                color = "red",
                linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Bell Curve of Horsepower",
       x = "Horsepower",
       y = "Density")


```
interpretation
The distribution indicates that most vehicles operate within a moderate horsepower range. High-performance vehicles are limited, supporting the suitability of moderate-power vehicles for road safety and controlled driving conditions in Sri Lanka.


Curb Weight Analysis

```{r}
mean_weight <- mean(auto$curb_weight)
median_weight <- median(auto$curb_weight)
sd_weight <- sd(auto$curb_weight)

mean_weight
median_weight
sd_weight

ggplot(auto, aes(x = curb_weight)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),
                 bins = 30,
                 fill = "orange",
                 color = "black") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = mean_weight, sd = sd_weight),
                color = "red",
                linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Bell Curve of Curb Weight",
       x = "Curb Weight (lbs)",
       y = "Density")


```
interpretation

The bell curve indicates that lighter vehicles are more common in the dataset. This supports fuel efficiency, reduced road wear, and improved maneuverability, which are important for Sri Lanka’s urban and semi-urban road networks.


Price Analysis
```{r}
mean_price <- mean(auto$price)
median_price <- median(auto$price)
sd_price <- sd(auto$price)

mean_price
median_price
sd_price

#Bell Curve
ggplot(auto, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),
                 bins = 30,
                 fill = "pink",
                 color = "black") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = mean_price, sd = sd_price),
                color = "red",
                linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Bell Curve of Vehicle Price",
       x = "Price (USD)",
       y = "Density")


```
interpretation
The price distribution shows greater variability with a right-skewed pattern, indicating the presence of high-priced vehicles. In this case, the median price provides a more accurate representation of a typical vehicle cost, supporting fair pricing and taxation decisions.
